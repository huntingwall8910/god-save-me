        <p>A common misconception with cheating is that it's hard, or you need to be a master 1337 hacker to do it</p>

        <h2>
            how do they actually work?
        </h2>
        <p>Internal Game cheats use a .dll file to attach itself to a game or program to edit the memory</p>
        <p>what the dll does is basically make the game think that the dll is part of the game, which is called injection or attaching</p>

        <caption>Cheat Engine scanning memory</caption>
        <p>internal game cheats aren't going to affect data because it's serversided</p>
        <p>serverside data may include thnigs like in game currency, or levels, because that data is stored on the server.</p>

        <p>This is an example of esp, where it modifies the visuals where you can see the hitboxes of other players</p>
        <p>It works because it can read game code, which it can pull the position of hitboxes.</p>
        <h2>Common cheats and why they work</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Wall Hack: tells the game that the walls are transparent</li>
            <li>Aimbot: takes the position of a hitbox, and makes the character point to it</li>
            <li>Auto-anything: integrated macro</li>
            <li>God Mode: set health to an ungodly number</li>
            <li>Speed/Jump Hacks: set WS/JP to whatever</li>
            <li>Literally everyhing else: Memory editing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How can games detect this?</h2>
        <p>The most obvious solution is to detect the dll injecting</p>
        <p>For specific cheats, games can use creatice techniques to detct them. Like aimbot, where the game can make a fake player.</p>
        <p>Or for Automation cheats, where it can stop you if you make too many inputs too quickly</p>
